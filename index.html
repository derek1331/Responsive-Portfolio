            <p>I was born in Gainesville, Florida. But unfortunately moved to Tallahhassee when I was 1. Relectuctantly I started
                working for my brothers best friend at Jimmy John's. Eventually he and his wife bought their own store in Vero
                Beach and I moved with them. It was an interesting experience but overall I enjoyed it and am very grateful of
                them. I'm a bandwagon fan of almost all sports; Go Gators! I love playing soccer, so if you know where I can
                play please reach me by email.</p>
